Objective:
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the "penguins" dataset, 
exploring various aspects of the data, and gaining insights into the characteristics of different penguin species.


Univariate Analysis:

Visualize the distribution of categorical variables using countplots (e.g., 'sex', 'species', 'island').
Utilize a pie chart to show the distribution of records across different islands.
Explore the distribution of continuous variables like 'bill_length_mm' and 'bill_depth_mm' using distribution plots.
Use a violin plot to visualize the body mass distribution across different penguin species.

Multivariate Analysis:

Compute and visualize the correlation matrix.
Generate a heatmap to represent the correlation values between different continuous variables.

Bivariate Analysis:

Explore the relationship between 'body_mass_g' and 'flipper_length_mm' using a scatter plot.
Visualize the distribution of flipper length based on sex and species using a bar plot.
Utilize a point plot to compare flipper length across different penguin species.
